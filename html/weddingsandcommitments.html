                    ><br> A wedding is (hopefully!) a once in lifetime event and as such it is imperative that you have the
                    opportunity to explore what this ceremony means to you, which means being listened to and having
                    the space to acknowledge the magic and joy of your memories and anecdotes and then distil them
                    into a meaningful and poignant ceremony that will be a touchstone for the days, months and years
                    ahead as you move through the emotional process of a life together.</p>
