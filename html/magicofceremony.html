         <h1>The Magic of Ceremony</h1>
      </header>

         <p>
            Having a truly hand-crafted ceremony can be exhilarating, joyous, healing, inspiring, graceful or
            profound; a time to discover the extraordinary in the ordinary, and above all, an experience to
            cherish. A ceremony allows us a space to pause in the busy pace of modern life. It is a recognition of
            the need to express and experience a sense of meaning and belonging.

            It&#8217s all about you, your family, and your guests. You want to share a remarkable experience, and have
            a vision of how you would like it to be. Yet perhaps you are unsure how to knit all the pieces
            together. Whether it is some kind of commitment or wedding ceremony, special life transition or a
            funeral or memorial, you can relax and I will sensitively and professionally guide your next steps.

               must have known us for 10 years at least!! Thank you, you really took so much time and care to make
               it so fitting to James and I and we really appreciate it so much."

            As a creative and intuitive Independent Celebrant, I work with you to design and lead uplifting and
            meaningful ceremonies that are personalised and unique. Together we co-create an experience that
            will enable everyone involved to reconnect with what makes for truly whole-hearted living. I take
            time to listen to your stories, and then weave together words, music, readings and rituals that
            reflect who you are, your experiences, ideas, beliefs and values.
         </p>

         <p>
            If you believe that your ceremony is worthy of devoting quality time, energy, passion and expertise
            to it, then we will make a great team!
         </p>

            <i>"The script you wrote captured the exact sentiments we were hoping for and we have, as a result, had
               lots of comments about how great the whole afternoon was. From meeting and talking to us for a
               relatively short time you managed to work out exactly what we wanted, which we were so impressed
               with."
