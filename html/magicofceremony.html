            <p>THE MAGIC OF CEREMONY<br
                ><br> Having a truly hand-crafted ceremony can be exhilarating, joyous, healing, inspiring, graceful or
                profound; a time to discover the extraordinary in the ordinary, and above all, an experience to
                cherish. A ceremony allows us a space to pause in the busy pace of modern life. It is a recognition of
                the need to express and experience a sense of meaning and belonging.<br
                ><br> It’s all about you, your family, and your guests. You want to share a remarkable experience, and have
                a vision of how you would like it to be. Yet perhaps you are unsure how to knit all the pieces
                together. Whether it is some kind of commitment or wedding ceremony, special life transition or a
                funeral or memorial, you can relax and I will sensitively and professionally guide your next steps.<br
                ><br> <i>"The script is so brilliant!!! We were both smiling so much when we read it!!! It really does feel like you
                must have known us for 10 years at least!! Thank you, you really took so much time and care to make
                it so fitting to James and I and we really appreciate it so much."</i><br
                ><br> As a creative and intuitive Independent Celebrant, I work with you to design and lead uplifting and
                meaningful ceremonies that are personalised and unique. Together we co-create an experience that
                will enable everyone involved to reconnect with what makes for truly whole-hearted living. I take
                time to listen to your stories, and then weave together words, music, readings and rituals that
                reflect who you are, your experiences, ideas, beliefs and values.<br
                ><br> If you believe that your ceremony is worthy of devoting quality time, energy, passion and expertise
                to it, then we will make a great team!<br
                ><br> The first step is for us to meet and talk through your needs. This initial contact is free and can be at
                your home, in a café or by phone or Skype.<br
                ><br> <i>"The script you wrote captured the exact sentiments we were hoping for and we have, as a result, had
                lots of comments about how great the whole afternoon was. From meeting and talking to us for a
                relatively short time you managed to work out exactly what we wanted, which we were so impressed
                with."</i></p>
