                <p>WHY CHOOSE TO WORK WITH ME?<br
                    ><br><i>"We got such positive vibes from you, and when we met you for the first time in the cafe knew that you
                        would be perfect for our ceremony!""</i><br
                        ><br>You may have looked at many celebrant websites as well as mine and be thinking – how do I
                        choose?! Or it may be that mine is the only one you’ve looked at so far and you’re wondering
                        whether to cast your net further?<br
                        ><br>So aside from the obvious things you’re probably looking for in a celebrant (fully trained, insured
                        and experienced, good listener, personal service, professional etc) here are a few extra things that I
                        believe set me apart, and may help to make your choice a bit easier, or your search a bit shorter!...<br
                        ><br>It’s about you, not me<br
                        ><br>Totally and wholeheartedly involved<br
                        ><br>I have a way with words<br
                        ><br>And yes, I do listen well, and I also ask the right questions<br
                        ><br>I'm just me<br
                        ><br>I  'm an organiser<br
                        ><br>Whether it’s an extended family get-together or a work’s Christmas dinner, I’ve always been the one
                        to step forward and get it organised. Not because I’m a martyr when no-one else will do it, but
                        because I love it, considering all the requirements of those involved and bringing something
                        wonderful to fruition – it’s a kind of magic I’m happy to perform!<br
                        ><br>I’m always ready to do the unusual!<br
                        ><br>As well as the more usual ceremonies, I’ve worn a Chelsea football shirt for a funeral and donned my
                        wellies for a wedding in the woods, my scarf for a windy wedding in a field in winter, I’ve facilitated a
                        blessing of motherhood and created a ceremony to welcome the summer.<br
                        ><br>People are what’s important!<br
                        ><br>I feel privileged to be able to meet and get to know people at times of significant transition periods
                        in their lives – the joy and excitement of a couple gathering their friends and family to witness their
                        love for each other, or welcoming a new being into their lives. Individuals who want the pleasure of
                        making a significant birthday a little bit more than just another number, another year older, or
                        perhaps acknowledge the exhilarating fear of stepping into retirement. And the honour of working

                        with ordinary folk who suddenly find themselves in a position they never wanted to be in, grieving
                        the loss of someone they loved.</p>
